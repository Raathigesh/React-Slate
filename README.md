### What is React Slate?
React slate is an interactive playground for your React JS experiments. React slate makes exploring UI kits such as Blueprint JS, Semantic UI React, React Toolbox easy and fun. These UI kits are supported through installable npm packages called component kits.

Also React slate could be used to quickly try out react libraries and ideas rather than spending time on setting up the tools.

### When can I take a look at this thing?
I made good progress so far with the initial version. There will be an initial release real sooon.
